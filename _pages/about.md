I am a postgraduate student from the Faculty of Education, [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). My research interests include generative artificial intelligence, AI literacy, prompt literacy, and big concepts.

I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor Gu Xiaoqing from East China Normal University.
